# 3D-Printing repository

## What can you find here?

I occasionally design some 3d parts, mostly for modifying my 3d printers. You
can find all of my designs here. I usually supply the STL files for printing,
some images (renders and/or photos) and the source files (SCAD or Fusion 360).

Please refer to the various subfolder for the individual models and further
documentation.

## Dislaimer

I designed the models contained in this repository for my own personal use.
Feel free to use them within the bounds of the GPL v3, but
be aware that I do not guarantee that you will be able to print these files
properly. I cannot be held responsible for failed prints and other damages.

Use these files at your own risk.
