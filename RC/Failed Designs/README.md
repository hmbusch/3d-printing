# Failed designs

In this folder you will find various SCAD models I created for various RC purposes but ended up not using them. Usually when building something, I encounter a problem and try to work around that problem. Many times when rethinking the whole build process, these designs seem to be unecessary, sub-par or just plain wrong.
I still keep these files in case I want to revisit them for some special SCAD solutions or specfic bits and pieces.

## DISCLAIMER
As I said, all the design are failed designs. You can use them, let yourself be inspired by them, do what you like - but do it your own risk.
